# c2s1_Lab_1_OOP
The Ratio class, which is a fraction.
1. Implement the appropriate constructors: default, copying
and initialization with one (for the case of integers) or a pair of integers.
2. Implement the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division of numbers (both among themselves and with integers).
3. Implement the comparison of numbers for equality and in order (both between
with each other and with integers).
4. Realize the raising of fractions to an integer degree.
5. Implement access to the numerator and denominator (reading and
modification).
6. Implement the ability to get the whole and fractional (correct
fraction) parts of the fraction.
7. Implement the ability to convert a fraction to a floating point number
floating point, as well as an integer (getting the whole part).
8. Implement assignment operations.
9. Implement a check whether a fraction is an integer.
